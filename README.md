# gd-minimal

A template project structure I will be using for Godot projects that I will update accordingly.

# Setup

Before cloning, make sure Git LFS is installed.
This repository uses the "assets/" folder in order to store respective resources such as textures, models, audio, etc.

# Usage

This project is meant to be structured for a GDScript only project. Further changes may be made to allow for a C# Project like adding an "src/" folder.

The settings different from the Godot default include the following.

Project Settings

-   debug/gdscript/warnings/untyped_declaration: error

Recommended Editor Settings (These settings aren't immmediately configured but recommended to start with.)

-   text_editor/completion/add_type_hints: true
